## üöÄ How to Use

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vitinnsz/Website-Tester.git
cd Website-Tester
```

The project uses a `requirements.txt` file to list all necessary Python dependencies. You can install them in two ways: using Docker or in a local virtual environment.

### üê≥ Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

The simplest way to run, without worrying about dependencies. Docker uses the `requirements.txt` file to build an isolated environment with everything the tool needs.

```bash
docker-compose run --rm website-tester
```
> **Note**: The `docker-compose run` command allows for interactive data input, such as the website URL.

### üêç Option 2: Local Environment (Python 3.8+)

To run locally, it is recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate the project's dependencies.

#### Using `uv` (Fast and Modern)
`uv` is an extremely fast package installer and virtual environment manager. If you are looking for maximum performance during installation, this is the best option.

```bash
# Install uv if you don't have it: pip install uv
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

#### Using `venv` + `pip` (Standard)
If you don't have `uv` or prefer the traditional Python approach, use `venv` to create the environment and `pip` to install the packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## üîß Configuration

You can customize the tool's behavior by editing the `config.py` file:

```python
# config.py
LANGUAGE = "en-us"        # Report language
FIXED_URL = True          # Use a fixed URL or ask on each run
URL = "https://example.com" # URL to use if FIXED_URL is True
BROKEN_LINKS = True       # Enable broken link checking
CHECK_DOMAIN_INFO = True  # Enable domain information query
LINK_SAMPLE_SIZE = 50     # Number of links to sample for checking
```

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

Features planned for the future:

- [ ] **Report Export**: Save analyses in JSON, CSV, TXT, and Markdown.
- [ ] **REST API**: Make the tool available as a service for external consumption.
- [ ] **CI/CD Integration**: Facilitate use in automation pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions).
- [ ] **Advanced Performance Analysis**: Include metrics like Core Web Vitals.
- [ ] **Cookie Verification**: Analyze compliance with LGPD and GDPR.
